# Capstone1_Restaurants (Planning Phase)

## Initial Ideas

- Create a website that users/consumers are looking for specific restaurants or recommendations based on nearby
locations or different cuisines (food categories), if they are open now, etc.
- Users would be able to see/view the additional information(contract, address, menus, reviews) about the restaurants. 
- Users can 'favorite' restaurants, add food to cart to calculate total, add personal notes to a restaurants. (Users need
to create an account to do thoses!)
- Create a checkout system (Stripe API)
